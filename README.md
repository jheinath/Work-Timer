# WorkTimerPython

A little tkinter UI build with Python to help my brother track his tasks at work. Python language was prefered, because he's working on a Mac.

The main purpose of this application is to find out how many tasks per minute the user is currently doing. So that you are not working too fast or too slow. It also show's you how far behind or how far ahead you are with your tasks.
